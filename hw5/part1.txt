-symbolic link:
         symbolic link (also symlink or soft link) is a term for any file that 
      contains a reference to another file or directory in the form of an absolute or relative path
      and that affects pathname resolution.
         A symbolic link contains a text string that is automatically interpreted and followed by the operating system 
      as a path to another file or directory. This other file or directory is called the "target". 
      The symbolic link is a second file that exists independently of its target. If a symbolic link is deleted, its target     
      remains unaffected. 
          storage of the target path within the data structures used for storing file information on disk (inodes). 
      This space normally stores a list of disk block addresses allocated to a file. Thus, symlinks with short target 
      paths are accessed quickly. 
        
   Advantage:
          symbolic links can point to any file or directory irrespective of the volumes on which the link and target reside.
      It could cross over different file systems.
-hard link:
         hard link is a directory entry that associates a name with a file on a file system. All directory-based file systems  
      must have at least one hard link giving the original name for each file. The term “hard link” is usually only used in 
      file systems that allow more than one hard link for the same file. hard link has the effect of giving one file multiple 
      names (e.g. different names in different directories) all of which independently connect to the same data on the disk, 
      none of which depends on any of the others.
   Adventage:
         hard links don't have size or speed penalty. Soft links takes a small extra amount of time to open the 
      file. symbolic link also takes a small amount of space on the disk.The hard link can also be used as a backup plan in the 
      system because each file is the same. Therefore, if we lose a file, we still have the others

	The virtual address in binary form is
	0001 0001 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110
	Since the page size is 2^12,the page table size is 2^20
	Therefore, the low-order 12 bits (0100 0101 0110) are used as the displacement into the page
	the remaining 20 bits (0001 0001 0001 0010 0011) are used as the displacement in the page table.
