1.
    (a) •Pages are classified according to R and M
        – Class 0: not referenced, not modified
        – Class 1: not referenced, modified (R bit has been cleared!) 
        – Class 2: referenced, not modified
        – Class 3: referenced, modified
        NRU removes page at random from lowest numbered non empty class
        so, answer is Page 0, because it’s R = M = 0.
     (b) Page 2, In the FIFO queue page 2 is the oldest loaded page.
     (c) Page 1, page 1’s last reference time is 260,it is the oldest referenced time.
     (d) second chance replace is following below rules
         •Pages in list are sorted in FIFO order
         •R bits are cleared regularly 
         •If the R bit of the oldest page is set it is put at the end of the list
         •If all the pages in the list have been referenced the page that 
          was “recycled” will reappear with the R bit cleared and will be 
          thrown away
          The page 2’s R bit is 1, will put at the end of the list by FIFO replace scheduler.
          and page 0 R bit is 0
          so, answer is page 0
2.
    fifo queue:
    (page load first)N <- G <- H <- D <- A <- L <- C <- B(most recently loaded page)
    rules is same as 1.d 
    so, answer is page D
3. 
    Virtual vs Physical Addresses
    – Physical addresses refer to hardware addresses of physical memory.
    – Virtual addresses refer to the virtual store viewed by the process
    • virtual addresses might be the same as physical addresses
    • might be different, in which case virtual addresses must be mapped into physical
       addresses.Mapping is done by Memory Management Unit (MMU).
    • virtual space is limited by size of virtual addresses (not physical addresses)
    • virtual space and physical memory space are independent
4.  
    • Same concept as Second Chance, different implementation ,so choose same pages to replace

    page 0	01101110
    page 1	01001001
    page 2	00110111
    page 3	10001011
